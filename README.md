# mockGalaxy

Mock Galaxy is my final project of Computer Graphics. 

-----------------------

I test my code both in Windows and Linux system.

## Features

I add some magic features to my project. As a student who has taken the special relativity course, I do relativity correction in GLSL code. And I use Monte-Carlo alghrithm to generate the canvas of my universe.

More details about my project are shown on my project report. I won't bother to write them again here.
